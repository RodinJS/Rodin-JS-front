      <h3 class="text-yellow">How do I find my Windows product key ?</h3>
      <p>Windows 8.1 and Windows 10</p>
      <p>The product key is located inside the product packaging, on the receipt or confirmation page for a digital
        purchase or in a confirmation e-mail that shows you purchased Windows. If you purchased a digital copy from
        Microsoft Store, you can locate your product key in your Account under Digital Content.</p>
      <p>Windows 7</p>
      <p>The product key is located inside the box that the Windows DVD came in, on the DVD, on the receipt or
        confirmation page for a digital purchase or in a confirmation e-mail that shows you purchased Windows. If you
        purchased a digital copy from Microsoft Store, you can locate your product key in your Account under Digital
        Content.</p>

      <h3 class="text-yellow">My windows 7 product key won't verify. What's the problem ?</h3>
      <p>The most common issue is the use of a product key for a product not currently supported by the site such as an
        Upgrade key, an MSDN key, product keys for pre-installed media or an Enterprise edition key. For access to MSDN
        products or Enterprise edition visit the MSDN Portal or the Volume Licensing Service Center. Upgrades and
        pre-installed media are not currently supported by the tools on the site.</p>

      <h3 class="text-yellow">I'we downloaded an ISO file, now what ?</h3>
      <p>You can use the ISO file to create bootable media for installation or recovery. You can also install Windows on
        your current device by opening the ISO file, selecting the Setup and following the instructions.</p>
      <p>To create bootable media such as a bootable USB drive or DVD, you will need an ISO burning or mounting
        software. We recommend always using a blank USB or blank DVD because contents may be deleted when creating a
        bootable image.</p>

      <h3 class="text-yellow">Is the media bootable ?</h3>
      <p>The media from this site can be used to create bootable USB drives and DVDs which will allow you to access
        recovery tools.</p>
