                    <strong>Term and Termination.</strong> This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
                    remain in effect for a period of ninety (90) days (the “Pilot Period”) unless terminated earlier as
                    set forth below. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon notice to the other
                    party. If the Rodin Service becomes, or Rodin believes may become, the subject of any claim, suit or
                    proceeding alleging infringement of any intellectual property right, or otherwise restricted or
                    prohibited, Rodin may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to you. Upon expiration of
                    the Pilot Period or termination of this Agreement, the licenses granted hereunder shall terminate
                    effective immediately and, you shall promptly (a) discontinue use of the Rodin Service, and any
                    other Rodin Confidential Information; (b) return, at your expense, any Rodin Confidential
                    Information or Content in your possession or control; (c) destroy all electronic copies of any Rodin
                    Confidential Information; and (d) certify that you have complied with the foregoing requirements.
                    The rights and duties of the parties under Sections 2, 4.3, 5, and 7-11 will survive the termination
                    or expiration of this Agreement.
